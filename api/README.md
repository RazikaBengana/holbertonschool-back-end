## :eye: About

<br>

<div align="center">

**`API`** project consists of `Python` scripts that interact with a JSON placeholder API to retrieve user and task data, allowing for data processing and storage in various formats such as JSON and CSV.
<br>
The scripts serve specific purposes, including fetching user details, exporting data to files, and organizing tasks by user, providing a comprehensive set of tools for working with the API data.
<br>
<br>
This project has been created by **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/about-holberton)** to enable every student to understand how an API works.

### Background Context

<br>

### `APIs`:

<br>
<br>

[![APIs](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dqn08N7Zx0Lw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn08N7Zx0Lw)

<br>
<br>

Old-school system administrators usually only know `Bash` and that is what they use to build their scripts.

While `Bash` is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages.

The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs (_Site Reliability Engineers_), are pretty much regular software engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems.

And one of the big differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just `Bash` scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an `API`.

Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – access and modify their data.

In this project, you will access employee data via an `API` to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for `Bash` scripting, so let’s build `Python` scripts.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tasks

<br>

**`0. Gather data from an API`**

**`1. Export to CSV`**

**`2. Export to JSON`**

**`3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries`**

<br>
<br>

## :memo: Learning Objectives

<br>

**_You are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:_**

<br>

```diff

General

+ What Bash scripting should not be used for

+ What is an API

+ What is a REST API

+ What are microservices

+ What is the CSV format

+ What is the JSON format

+ Pythonic Package and module name style

+ Pythonic Class name style

+ Pythonic Variable name style

+ Pythonic Function name style

+ Pythonic Constant name style

+ Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

```

<br>
<br>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## :computer: Requirements

<br>

```diff

General

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

+ All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.X)

+ All your files should end with a new line

+ The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

+ Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order

+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

+ Your code should use the pycodestyle

+ All your files must be executable

+ The length of your files will be tested using wc

+ All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')

+ You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)

- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)

```

<br>

**_Why all your files should end with a new line? See [HERE](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)_**
